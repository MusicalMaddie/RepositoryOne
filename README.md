- 👋 Hi, I’m @MusicalMaddie
- 👀 I’m interested in e-ink screens, smart home & automation/device voice control, IFTTT, and music applications (such as organ samplers or sheet music storage).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at Tech Elevator, but personally exploring python and programming with API's and e-ink screens in my spare time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects using API's and e-ink screens.
- 📫 How to reach me: ....not yet? Comment? Still learning github :)
